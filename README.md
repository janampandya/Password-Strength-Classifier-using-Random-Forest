# Password-Strength-Classifier-using-Random-Forest
This project implements a Password Strength Classifier using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset containing passwords labeled with their strength levels (Weak, Medium, or Strong). The passwords are transformed into numerical features using the TfidfVectorizer, and a RandomForestClassifier model is trained on the dataset.
